## Cloning Instructions

After using a fork of this repo as a template to create a new repository, you must install the necessary dependencies:

## Dependencies

The [Essentials](https://github.com/PepperDash/Essentials) libraries are required. They referenced via nuget. You must have nuget.exe installed and in the `PATH` environment variable to use the following command. Nuget.exe is available at [nuget.org](https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe).

### Installing Dependencies

To install dependencies once nuget.exe is installed, run the following command from the root directory of your repository:
`nuget install .\packages.config -OutputDirectory .\packages -excludeVersion`.
To verify that the packages installed correctly, open Essentials and make sure that all references are found, then try and build it.

### Installing Different versions of PepperDash Core

If you need a different version of PepperDash Core, use the command `nuget install .\packages.config -OutputDirectory .\packages -excludeVersion -Version {versionToGet}`. Omitting the `-Version` option will pull the version indicated in the packages.config file.
